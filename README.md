# vim-py-runner
Python Runner

To install the plugin, simple copy the script file to your local plugin folder in the vim folder e.g. `~/.vim/plugin/py-runner.py`

You can use `F8` to run the script (doesn't need to be saved). Also, you can exit the output buffer by pressing `q`

Only tested for running python scripts. However, it should work with other scripts as long as the vim version is `>=8.2`
